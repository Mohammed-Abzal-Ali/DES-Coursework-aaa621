MATLAB Files for aaa621's Discrete Event Systems Coursework.

To run, all files must be part of the same path.

Run DES.m script to get results. DES Script is currently setup for Question 4.

Also the Parallel functions seems to be a bit confused and the transitions between rooms are with the wrong direction, but I really have no time to update it. :(
